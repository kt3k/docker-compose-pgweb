# docker-compose-pgweb

Run

```
docker-compose up -d
```

and you'll get [pgweb](http://sosedoff.github.io/pgweb/) running on port 8081 on your machine.

Note: You can use `host.docker.internal` as your host machine's hostname. See https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-65-get-your-docker-hosts-ip-address-from-in-a-container for example.
